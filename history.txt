    "bot_response": "Theorem 2.2 shows that the residual norm converges quadratically to zero for any single-head SAN consisting of L layers with respect to the length d of inputs X as a function of \u03b2. This is an interesting result since it implies that adding more layers does not help in speeding up convergence.\n\nTo proceed, we analyze how tokens are mixed in each path at different levels. The proof is as follows:\n\nLet's start by understanding how tokens interact with paths. We know that paths from head i to head j can be viewed as a path through the heads of two independent layers (i.e., h1 and h2). At layer l, adding an MLP block can split the input into L different paths. Each of these paths has length equal to the number of nonzero indices on it. The total number of paths in this process is (H + 1)L.\n\nHowever, we want to understand how paths behave for different inputs X. For instance, let's consider the case when the input X = 0. We have the residual norm as follows:\nres(X) = X - 1x\u22a4\nThe residual norm of a single path is equal to the sum of squared differences between each element x and its left neighbor x-1Xl. For any path path, we can use binary matrix multiplication (i.e., Ppath matrices jointly depend on X). So, the residual norm of path p = (h1, ... , hL) depends on H + 1 paths.\n\nNow, let's look at each layer separately and analyze how tokens mix at different levels. Path H consists of L independent layers with each having a different number of nonzero indices h(i). The left neighbor x is a vector that contains the dot product between layer i-1 and i. The right neighbor x is also a vector containing the dot product between layer i and i+1. For any path p = (h1, ... , hL), we have paths p = (xk, ... , xk) with k > 0 for layer i and layers i+1 to L-1. The left neighbor x is a vector that contains the dot product between x and layer i-1Xl. The right neighbor x is also a vector containing the dot product between x and layer i.\n\nNow, let's look at paths in each layer independently. Path p = (xk) has length kL - 1 for layer i and l - 1 < iL for layer i+1 to L-1. It contains kL paths and 2(k + l) path splits, where k and kL are the number of nonzero indices on each path.\n\nFor the next layer, p = (xk), it's a single path that has length 0 and contains just one split. For this layer, we have paths p = xk. The left neighbor is just xk itself. For layers l+1 to L-1, there are kL + l - 2 paths where k = l and kL - 2.\n\nThe residual norm of path p depends on the total number of non-zero indices j across all paths, which is H. So, we have the residual norm as follows:\n\u2225res(p)\u22251,H = \u2225xk - xj\u22a4\u22251,H\nwhere xk = x1Xj and xj = xjk. The left neighbor xk depends on the dot product between layer i-1Xl and layer i-Xi, which is simply 1bij. And the right neighbor xjk also contains the dot product between xj and xii.\n\nIn summary, for path p = (xk) with k > 0 across all layers, we have H paths of length kL - 1 + l - 1 or 2(k + l) paths from layer i to layer j. The left neighbor is just the dot product between each path's elements and the right neighbor contains the dot product between every element in both paths' elements.\n\nNow let's consider paths p = xk with k > 0 across all layers of PpXjL = Pxk and Pjk, where the left neighbor is j, and the right neighbor is k. The residual norm for each path at this stage is equal to (H + l) \u00d7 (2(k + l)) paths.\n\nTo understand the convergence rate, we want to analyze how much faster tokens mix across different levels of paths as a function of input X. Let's look at what happens as input X gets larger. If we assume that each path p = xk has length kL - 1 + l - 1 or 2(k + l) paths from layer i to layer j, then the total number of non-zero indices is (k + l)(H + l) \u00d7 (2(k + l)) paths.\n\nHowever, with a large input X, we can see that each path's length increases exponentially. The left neighbor xk also increases faster than anything else, since it contains the dot product between elements from layer i to layer j. The right neighbor xjk also increases faster than everything else since it has more structure at different layers.\n\nFor each path p = (xk) with k > 0 across all paths, the residual norm converges quickly as a function of input X by using the truncated power method. We can analyze this inductively:\n\n1. For k = 0:\nres(p) = (H + l) \u00d7 (2(k + l)) paths.\n\n2. For L - 1 < k < l:\nres(p) = H \u00d7 (2(k + l) paths) + l \u00d7 (2L - l - 1)\n      = H(L - k)(k + l) + l \u00d7 (k + 2l - k + l - 1) = H(k + l) (k + l + l + k).\n\n3. For k = l:\n\nres(p) = (H + l) \u00d7 (2(k + l)) paths.\n\n4. For k > l:\nres(p) = H(L - k)(k + l) + l \u00d7 k.\n\nThe convergence rate is then L(\u221a(H \u00d7 (2(k + l)) + (k + l)(2L - l - 1) / k + 1 + l - 2). The bound simplifies to \u2225res(p)\u22251,H \u2264 \u220fk = 0 to K paths.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the residual norm of a single path converges quadratically with respect to its length (D x H \u00d7 L - 1 + kL) for any single-head SAN consisting of L layers with respect to X as a function of \u03b2. This implies that adding more layers does not help in speeding up convergence, and the self-attention heads mix tokens faster when formed from a low-rank matrix, leading to a cascading effect.\n\nTheorem 2.2 shows that adding more layers doesn't help in speeding up the convergence rate for any single-head SAN with respect to its length (D x H \u00d7 L - 1 + kL) as a function of \u03b2. This leads to a slower convergence rate even when the number of paths grows exponentially.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that the residual norm converges quadratically to zero quickly with respect to input X for any single-head SAN consisting of L layers with respect to X as a function of \u03b2, demonstrating that adding more layers doesn't help in speeding up convergence."

This implies that the residual norm of the first path converges quickly as a function of its length (doubly exponential with a cubic rate):\n\nProof sketch. To analyze how the formation of Ph is affected by the rank of the input, we start by writing X = \u2225X\u22121\u22251 \u2297X\u22121\u22a5Wl\u2225X\u22121\u22a5 and ||Wll||1\u2264\u03b2<\u221adH\u2225X\u22121\u2225X\u22121\u22a5\u2225w|\u221e\u2264\u03b2. This implies that:\n\nTheorem 2.3 states that for any single-head SAN consisting of L layers with ||Wl||1\u2264\u03b2<\u221adH\u2225X\u22121\u2225X\u22121\u22a5\u2225w|\u221e\u2264\u03b2, without skip connections.\n\nThis means that the rank of the input is greater than or equal to \u03b2 and that the matrix Wll has a lower rank. We can then analyze how the size of Ph affects the formation of Ph (rank of the input) in terms of its length as follows:\n\nTheorem 2.3 states that for any single-head SAN consisting of L layers with ||Wl||1\u2264\u03b2<\u221adH\u2225X\u22121\u2225X\u22121\u22a5\u2225w|\u221e\u2264\u03b2, without skip connections.\n\nThis means that the size of Ph is constrained by the rank of the input matrix Wll. As a consequence, the rank of the first path will be lower than \u03b2 and increase quickly as we build deeper SANs with more layers until the rank approaches 0 (doubly exponential rate). \n\nTheorem 2.3 also implies that the rank of attention matrices depends on the rank of input matrix X, and hence affects how fast tokens mix in the SAN's representation.\n\nWe can use this to infer additional information about how much faster tokens mix for a given input matrix X, based on the rank dependence on the rank of input.\nTheorem 2.3 also implies that if we build more layers on top of each other, the convergence rate will still be linear with respect to the length of path and the rank of input.\n\nIn summary, we have shown how the formation of Ph in a SAN is affected by the rank of the input matrix X when there are fewer paths (H) and without skip connections. The theorem guarantees that if we build deeper networks (L), this effect will still persist for at least two or three iterations with respect to the number of layers.\n\nNote: This proof uses the fact that the set of row-stochastic matrices is closed under multiplication, ||Wll||1\u2264\u03b2<\u221adH\u2225X\u22121\u2225X\u22121\u22a5\u2225w|\u221e\u2264\u03b2."
