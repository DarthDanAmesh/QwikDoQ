It seems to suggest that it is offered through a \"Master\" course at DAAD's Kew Campus in England. However, the information provided about starting dates and locations is based on a general idea of what is required by the course. \n\nFor further details or to request specifics, you might want to look into the specific requirements for a Master degree in MME offered through the DAAD programme at one of their Kew Campus locations. You could also look at the \"Master\" courses available from universities across South Africa and their respective admission criteria.\n\nTo address your need for specific information about where the course is offered, you might want to contact the university directly or search online for more detailed information."
